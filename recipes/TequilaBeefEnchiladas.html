    <h2>Tequila Slow-Cooked Beef Enchiladas
    </h2>
    <p>I get requests for this recipe all the time! I have made it with chicken and leftover Thanksgiving turkey as
        well, but beef is my favorite!

    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 (3 pound) beef roast</li>

        <li> 3 cups tequila</li>

        <li> 3 jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced</li>

        <li> 6 cloves garlic, smashed and diced</li>

        <li> 3 cups uncooked rice</li>

        <li> 2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained</li>

        <li> 1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>

        <li> 2 (6 ounce) cans diced green chile peppers, divided</li>

        <li> 4 (7.75 ounce) cans spicy enchilada sauce</li>

        <li> 2 (12 fluid ounce) cans mild enchilada sauce</li>

        <li> 2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>

        <li> 1 (12 ounce) bag shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>

        <li> 12 (12 inch) flour tortillas, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1
            Combine beef roast, tequila, jalapeno peppers, and garlic in a slow cooker. Cover and cook on Low until
            tender, 12 to 18 hours.</li>

        <li>Step 2
            Shred beef using 2 forks; let it cool, about 30 minutes. Transfer shredded beef to a plate using a slotted
            spoon, reserving cooking liquid in the slow cooker.</li>

        <li>Step 3
            Pour reserved cooking liquid into a large pot; stir in rice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low,
            cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>

        <li>Step 4
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Step 5
            Mix black beans, refried beans, and 1 can green chile peppers together in a bowl.</li>

        <li>Step 6
            Mix spicy enchilada sauce, mild enchilada sauce, and tomato paste together in a bowl until smooth. Spread a
            thin layer of sauce in the bottom of a deep baking dish.</li>

        <li>Step 7
            Spoon 1/4 cup bean mixture, 1/4 cup rice, 1/2 cup shredded beef, 1 tablespoon sauce, and 2 tablespoons
            Mexican cheese blend over 1 tortilla. Roll up tortilla and place seam side-down in the baking dish. Repeat
            with remaining ingredients until baking pan is full.</li>

        <li>Step 8
            Cover tortillas with a thick layer of sauce and remaining cheese. Spread remaining 1 can green chile peppers
            over cheese.</li>

        <li>Step 9
            Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubby and golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
