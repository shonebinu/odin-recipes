    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Sheet pan pancakes are one of my favorite breakfast hacks for busy mornings or breakfast meal prep. The
        buttermilk makes these baked pancakes light, fluffy, and oh-so-delicious! This sheet pan pancake recipe can be
        easily customized by adding your favorite fruit or other pancake toppings on top of the batter before cooking.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>3 cups baking mix</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large sheet pan or jelly roll pan with parchment
            paper. Spray the parchment paper with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>Combine baking mix, buttermilk, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a large mixing bowl. Mix until
            the ingredients are well combined, but don't overmix. Pour batter onto the parchment paper-lined pan.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 15 to 18 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove sheet pan from the oven. Lift the parchment paper with the pancake from the pan and set it onto a
            cutting board. Slice the pancake sheet into squares using a pizza cutter or into your desired shapes with a
            cookie cutter.
        </li>
    </ol>
